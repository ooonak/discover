## Overview

Discover is a TUI application used to discover devices. It's a Linux application that uses the Avahi protocol via D-BUS.

Avahi implements the Apple Zeroconf specification, mDNS, DNS-SD and RFC 3927/IPv4LL. Using multicast DNS and DNS Service Discovery Avahi provides zero configuration service discovery.
